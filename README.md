# json-types
TypeScript declarations for json files

* General json file definition
* Definition for package.json

# Usage

`npm install veridict/json-types`



# Remarks

The name of the bundle is `@types/json-types` in order to make it easier to use (`node_modules/@types` is automatically included). However, this can cause issues if there is a conflicting package from https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped.
